"""Build the SDK-free C++ test programs when they are missing or stale.

The Python/C++ parity tests need the C++ side to have been compiled FROM THE
CODE AS IT IS NOW. They used to skip when it had not been, and a skip reads, in a
green run, exactly like a pass: test_cpp_golden_is_current skipped in every run
anyone looked at, so the comparison had been against a snapshot committed with
#325 and never against the C++ core -- which in the meantime stopped agreeing
with Python about which vehicle it was spawning, and nothing noticed.

So this builds them. It skips only when there is nothing to build with (not
Windows, or no MSVC), and says so. A build that fails is a FAILURE, with the
compiler's output, not a skip: it means the C++ core no longer compiles, which
is the most important thing a parity test can report.
