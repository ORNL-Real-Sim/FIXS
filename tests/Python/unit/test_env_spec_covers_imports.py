"""Every third-party import in the Python FIXS ships must be in environment.yml.

#378: Carla/carla_agents' global_route_planner imports networkx, environment.yml
did not list it, and an env built from the spec could not import BasicAgent or
BehaviorAgent at all -- mainVirCarla exited at startup and run_cosim stopped the
whole stack. The declaration existed, in requirements.txt (#305) -- a file that
no install path reads -- and nothing compared the two manifests.

This walks the shipped Python instead, so the check is against what the code
actually imports rather than against a second hand-written list.
