# Configuration Reference

The Real-Sim interface is configured through YAML files (for example `config.yaml`). Each top-level section maps directly to structures parsed in `CommonLib/ConfigHelper`. This document describes the supported keys, their defaults, and any special behaviour such as derived paths.

> **Path handling.** Unless stated otherwise, relative paths are resolved against the directory that contains the config file. The interface also accepts absolute paths.

## SimulationSetup

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EnableRealSim | bool | true | Master switch for the interface. |
| EnableVerboseLog | bool | false | Enables detailed logging in TrafficLayer and companion tools. |
| SimulationEndTime | double | 90000 | End time (seconds). Large default keeps the session open until external shutdown. |
| EnableExternalDynamics | bool | false | When true, SUMO speed updates use `setPreviousSpeed` so acceleration limits are respected. |
| VehicleMessageField | string list | All supported fields | Controls which vehicle fields are exchanged. Provide a subset if bandwidth is a concern. Must include `id`, `speed`, and one of `speedDesired` or `accelerationDesired`. |
| SelectedTrafficSimulator | string | `"SUMO"` | Use `"SUMO"` or `"VISSIM"`. |
| TrafficSimulatorIP | string | `"127.0.0.1"` | Host for TraCI/VISSIM connections. |
| TrafficSimulatorPort | int | 1337 | Port for the selected simulator. |
| SimulationMode | int | 0 | Bitmask mode as documented in the README. |
| SimulationModeParameter | double | 0 | Auxiliary parameter consumed by selected modes. |
| TrafficLayerIP | string | inferred | Defaults to the first vehicle subscription IP if not provided. |
| TrafficLayerPort | int | inferred | Defaults to the first vehicle subscription port if not provided. |

## SumoSetup

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SpeedMode | int | 0 | Passed to `SUMO_TRACI_NAMESPACE::Vehicle::setSpeedMode`. Common values: 0 (default safety), 31 (default mode), 32 (all checks off). |
| ExecutionOrder | int | 1 | Order passed to `Simulation::setOrder`. |
| EnableAutoLaunch | bool | false | When true, TrafficLayer starts SUMO automatically; otherwise it expects a running instance. |
| SumoConfigFile | string | `""` | Path to `.sumocfg` used when auto-launching. Relative paths resolved against config file directory. |
| NumClients | int | 1 | Number of SUMO clients negotiated during auto-launch. |
| RuntimeLibraryPath | string | `""` | Optional override for the SUMO runtime directory (DLL/.so path). |

When `RuntimeLibraryPath` is omitted the executable searches for the libsumo runtime in the following order:

1. `libsumo\bin` located next to `TrafficLayer.exe`.
2. `CommonLib\libsumo\bin` relative to the executable, walking up to four parent directories (covers `TrafficLayer/x64/<Config>` and `build`).
3. `CommonLib\libsumo\bin` relative to the current working directory.

On Windows the resolved folder is supplied to `SetDllDirectory`. On Linux the folder is prepended to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Leave the field commented out unless you intentionally repackage the SUMO binaries elsewhere.

## ApplicationSetup

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EnableApplicationLayer | bool | false | Enables the application message bus. |
| ApplicationPort | int list | [] | Ports that receive messages (alternative to subscription-based port definition). |
| VehicleSubscription | list of subscription blocks | [] | Each block has `type`, an `attribute` map, `ip`, and `port`. |
| DetectorSubscription | list of subscription blocks | [] | Detector data subscriptions. |
| SignalSubscription | list of subscription blocks | [] | Traffic signal subscriptions. |

### Subscription Types

**VehicleSubscription** supports the following types:
- `ego`: Subscribe by vehicle ID. Attributes: `id` (list), `radius` (list), or `all` (bool).
- `link`: Subscribe by edge/link ID. Attributes: `id` (list).
- `point`: Subscribe by geographic point. Attributes: `x`, `y`, `z`, `radius` (all lists).
- `vehicleType`: Subscribe by vehicle type. Attributes: `id` (list), `radius` (list).

**SignalSubscription** supports:
- `intersection`: Subscribe by signal controller. Attributes: `name` or `id` (list).

**DetectorSubscription** supports:
- `detector`: Subscribe by detector pattern. Attributes: `pattern`, `name`, or `id` (list).

Example subscription block:

```yaml
VehicleSubscription:
-   type: ego
    attribute: {id: ['ego'], radius: [0]}
    ip: ['127.0.0.1']
    port: [2444]
```

## XilSetup

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EnableXil | bool | false | Enables the co-simulation bridge. |
| AsServer | bool | false | When true, TrafficLayer listens for XIL connections; otherwise acts as client. |
| VehicleSubscription | list | [] | Same schema as the application-layer subscriptions. |
| SignalSubscription | list | [] | Signal subscriptions for XIL. |
| DetectorSubscription | list | [] | Detector subscriptions for XIL. |

When the application layer is disabled but XIL is enabled, the interface automatically reuses the XIL vehicle subscriptions to seed outbound traffic.

## CarMakerSetup

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EnableCosimulation | bool | false | Turn on integration with IPG CarMaker. |
| EnableEgoSimulink | bool | false | When true, ego state comes from Simulink; when false, from User.cpp. |
| CarMakerIP | string | inferred or `"127.0.0.1"` | Connection IP for CarMaker. Inferred from subscription if single vehicle subscribed. |
| CarMakerPort | int | inferred or 7331 | Connection port for CarMaker. Inferred from subscription if single vehicle subscribed. |
| TrafficRefreshRate | double | 0.001 | How often traffic poses are re-applied to CarMaker, i.e. CarMaker's own step. **Not** the FIXS exchange period, which is a fixed 0.1 s — the core interpolates each sample (position, heading, grade) across the sub-steps in between, so 0.001 means smooth 1 kHz traffic motion off a 10 Hz feed. |
| EgoId | string | inferred or `"egoCm"` | Identifier for the ego vehicle in SUMO. Inferred from subscription if single vehicle subscribed. |
| EgoType | string | `""` | SUMO vehicle type for ego. Empty uses SUMO default. |
| SynchronizeTrafficSignal | bool | false | If enabled, subscribes to all signal controllers for synchronization. |
| TrafficSignalPort | int | 2444 or inferred | Port for signal data. Inferred from SignalSubscription if available. |

## CarlaSetup

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EnableVerboseLog | bool | false | Verbose logging for the CARLA bridge. |
| EnableCosimulation | bool | false | Enables CARLA co-simulation. |
| EnableExternalControl | bool | false | When true, SUMO vehicles updated from CARLA state; when false, CARLA only visualizes. |
| UseVehicleTypeAsBlueprint | bool | false | Interpret SUMO vehicle types as CARLA blueprints. |
| CarlaServerIP | string | `"127.0.0.1"` | CARLA server endpoint IP. |
| CarlaServerPort | int | 2000 | CARLA server endpoint port. |
| CarlaClientIP | string | inferred or `"127.0.0.1"` | Client binding IP for CARLA streaming. Inferred from subscription if single vehicle. |
| CarlaClientPort | int | inferred or 2001 | Client binding port for CARLA streaming. Inferred from subscription if single vehicle. |
| CarlaMapName | string | `"Town01"` | Desired CARLA map name. |
| CenteredViewId | string | `"ego"` | Actor id used for camera centering. |
| CarlaTimeStep | double | 0 (= the FIXS feed) | CARLA world step, i.e. `fixed_delta_seconds`. Must be the FIXS feed period or an exact divisor of it (0.1 / 0.05 / 0.025 / 0.02 / 0.01): the exchange boundary is tested on the feed grid, so a tick that does not divide it never lands on one and the bridge would exchange nothing. Finer than the feed makes the bridge interpolate traffic — position **and** heading — across the sub-steps, exactly as the CarMaker host does at 0.001 s. |
| TrafficRefreshRate | double | 0 (= every tick) | How often traffic poses are **re-applied**. Same meaning as the CarMakerSetup key above; **not** the feed period. Must be ≥ `CarlaTimeStep` and have a whole reciprocal. Coarser than the tick = fewer `ApplyBatch` calls on a heavy scene while physics and sensors still run at the tick rate. |
| InterestedIds | string list | `["ego"]` | Vehicle IDs that receive mirrored CARLA updates. Should be subset of VehicleSubscription. |

> **The FIXS feed period is not configurable.** It is 0.1 s (`fixs::kFeedPeriodS` in
> `CommonLib/FixsProtocol.h`): every VirEnvCore host tests its send/recv boundary
> against that grid on its own sim clock, and TrafficLayer steps the traffic simulator
> exactly once per exchange. The traffic simulator's step length therefore **is** that
> value — `run_cosim` passes `--step-length 0.1` to both bridges rather than offering
> it as a choice. Give SUMO a different step and the two clocks run at different rates:
> at 0.05 s, CARLA advances two ticks per SUMO step, so every sample is drawn twice and
> the scene plays back at half speed.
>
> Before #219, `CarlaSetup.TrafficRefreshRate` doubled as the feed period *and* as the
> tick whenever `CarlaTimeStep` was unset — so setting it to 0.05 silently turned
> interpolation off. They are separate keys now and neither falls back to the other. An
> older yaml carrying a feed-period value in it is migrated (generated yamls) or
> reported (app-owned ones) by `run_cosim`.

## Updating the YAML

1. Copy an existing configuration (for example `tests/Python/SimpleEchoClient/config.yaml` or `tests/SumoCarla/test_scenarios/Town01_with_ego_type_as_blueprint/defaultConfig.yaml`).
2. Adjust the sections described above.
3. If SUMO auto-launch is enabled, ensure the `.sumocfg` path is valid and that either `RuntimeLibraryPath` is set or the default `CommonLib/libsumo/bin` directory remains beside the executable.
4. Keep indentation spaces (YAML does not support tabs).

For quick reference, see the inline comments in the test configuration files, which demonstrate various setup combinations.
