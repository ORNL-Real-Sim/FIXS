"""
carla_env_setup.py - one-time (or reconfigure) CARLA environment setup.

Prompts for the CARLA flavour and folder(s), validates them, and saves the choice
to ~/.fixs/carla.json. run_cosim.py reads that config and launches seamlessly; if
no config exists, run_cosim.py invokes this on the first run.

Three flavours:
  packaged  a released build (CarlaUE4.exe / .sh) - stock maps, plus library maps
            that publish a precooked build for this OS (Windows: experimental)
  source    an Unreal source build - the only one that can cook a custom map
  client    no CARLA on this machine at all. It says nothing about where CARLA
            is: there may be one on another host, reached over the network, or
            none anywhere. Traffic-only runs (run_cosim --sumo-only) need only
            SUMO and TrafficLayer, both of which run here; driving a remote CARLA
            additionally needs the carla PYTHON client, which is why that is
            offered rather than required. Either way: no install, no Unreal and
            no GPU on this machine.

Run this any time to switch CARLA (packaged <-> source build, or a different
install/version):

    python carla_env_setup.py                  # interactive
    python carla_env_setup.py --show           # print the current config
    python carla_env_setup.py --update-python  # rebind the env, keep the CARLA paths

Everything that runs a co-sim runs under the interpreter recorded here - see
reexec_under_configured, which every entry point calls first, so which script you
start with cannot change the env you end up in.

The config is stored per-machine outside any repo, so every FIXS app on this
computer reuses it and it is never git-tracked.
