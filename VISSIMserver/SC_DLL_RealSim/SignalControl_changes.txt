New features and bugfixes in the SignalControl.DLL API              (2017-04-05)
======================================================
(+ = new features, - = bugs that have been fixed. 
 Details about the fixes are in brackets.)

(2018-08-21)
+ lsa_fehl.h
  definition of sc_el_container and containers sg_fehler and det_fehler have been 
  added to the header file
  function CleanupErrorStatics() has been added to the header file
+ lsa_fehl.cpp
  definition of sc_el_container and containers sg_fehler and det_fehler have been 
  removed from the code file
  function CleanupErrorStatics() has been added to the code file


(2017-04-05)
------------
- lsa_fehl.cpp:
  DateiMeldung() now can handle locked error files.


(2016-07-15)
------------
* lsa_fehl.cpp: 
  fehlerabbruch() calls DateiMeldung() instead of nothing if the console mode 
  is active.

(2015-10-11)
------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp
  Added Unicode setter and getter ControllerSetValueW() and 
  ControllerGetValueW(). These are enabled if the compiler flag is set
  to support unicode. The old setter and getter ControllerSetValue() and 
  ControllerGetValue() are still functional, but without unicode support.
  The new Unicode interface is used only by Vissim 9 and later.
* multiple files
  use of TCHAR instead of char for unicode support.
  
(2015-06-25)
------------
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp
  Added SimTimeInSecondsSinceMidnight() to return sim time of day as a double.
+ SC_interface.h
  Added SC_DLL_DATA_OPTIMIZATION_NO_SIMTIMEOFDAY to suppress sending 
  sim time of day as a string.

(2015-06-24)
------------
+ SC_interface.h
  Added SC_DLL_DATA_OPTIMIZATION_NO_SIGNALGROUPS to suppress sending 
  signal groups.
  Added SC_DLL_DATA_OPTIMIZATION_NO_DETECTORS to supress sending detector 
  data.

(2015-04-29)
------------
* Multiple files: ported to Visual Studio 2013.
- Several problems fixed which could cause the controller DLL to crash,
  especially if the DLL was compiled with CLR support.

(2011-06-22)
------------
- lsa_puff.cpp:
  LongToLSAPuffer() deletes PT telegrams if the controller frequency is > 1.
  
(2011-05-02)
------------
- lsa_puff.cpp:
  Several possible floating point precision problems fixed.

(2011-03-29)
------------
+ SC_Interface.cpp:
  ppt_by_index() is much faster now, so SCJ/Det. Record data is passed much
  faster to VISSIM.

(2010-07-14)
------------
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  New function SC_Index(): returns the internal index of a controller (first
  controller: index = 1).
  New function SC_GetThirdSupplyFile(): returns the name of the third supply
  file of a controller (as defined in the SC dialog in VISSIM).

(2010-03-11)
------------
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  VISSIM asks the controller for the current CYCLESECOND, CYCLETIME, GREENEND, 
  REDEND, GREENEND2 and REDEND2 attributes that are accessible via COM. The new 
  methods SC_SetCycleTime, SG_GreenEnd, SG_RedEnd, SG_GreenEnd2, SG_RedEnd2 and
  SG_SetGreenEnd, SG_SetRedEnd, SG_SetGreenEnd2, SG_SetRedEnd2 allow accessing
  and changing the values.
- The CONTROLLER_DLL_NAME is now computed automatically and does not need to be 
  set by the developer anymore. This means that the DLL may be renamed now.

(2009-10-13)
------------
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  Added new function StopSimulation() that allows to cancel the simulation run
  from the external controller.
- sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  Det_FrontEndTime() and Det_RearEndTime() return the time in 1/100 seconds. 
  (The documentation says correctly time in seconds but the function returns 
  the wrong value.)
 
(2008-07-02)
------------
+ Added support for signal controllers written in .NET.
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  Added SC_DLL_DATA_RBC_LEVEL to pass the RBC level from VISSIM to the DLL.
  Added SC_DLL_CHECK_SIGNAL_SEQUENCE to switch on/off the check of the signal 
  sequence during the simulation run in VISSIM.
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  Added new function IsSimulationCanceled() to retrieve the information whether 
  the simulation run has been cancelled by the user or not. This allows to 
  distinguish between simulation runs that have completely finished and 
  cancelled runs.   
- lsa_puff.cpp:
  PT telegrams are not correctly handled if the signal controller frequency is 
  > 1.  
- sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  Function Signalgroups() has a typo [now renamed to SignalGroups()].
  SG_SetState () ignores the parameter <transition>.

(2007-05-23)
------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  Added support for silent mode of the simulation, using the code CONSOLE_MODE. 
  If this mode is set the controller should not display dialog boxes that wait 
  for user input.
  Added support for multirun and the parallel version of VISSIM. Both require
  that error file names contain the process id and simulation run index. 
  For this purpose VISSIM sends a number calculated as 
    process id * 100 + the index of the simulation run.
  After the simulation run the status of the controller is returned using the 
  code SC_DLL_DATA_TERMINATION, passing the error file name to VISSIM.
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  Added two iterators that allow to iterate over all signal groups or all
  detectors of the current SC. The iterators are returned by the function 
  Signalgroups() respectively Detectors().
  New function SG_Name() to retrieve the name of a  signal group.
  New function SGIdFromName() to get the number of a signal group with a given
  name.
  New functions Det_Name() and Det_Type() to retrieve the name and the type of
  a detector. The type differentiates between detectors for vehicular traffic 
  and detectors for pedestrians. Pedestrian detectors detect only vehicle types 
  with category pedestrian and "new" pedestrians (from the Add-on module 
  Pedestrian Simulation) on pedestrian links.
  New function DetIdFromName() to get the number of a detector with a given
  name.
  New functions IsConsoleMode() and ProcessSimRunID() to determine the mode
  that VISSIM is in for display of error messages and output file names.
- lsa_puff.cpp:
  LongToLSAPuffer() deletes the list of PT telegrams at the start of the data
  passed for each SC if the controller frequency is >1, so CP_Telegrams() 
  returns always zero if more than one SC uses this controller DLL.

(2005-11-18)
------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  New data type SC_DLL_DATA_SIM_DATE.
+ lsa_puff.h/.cpp:
  New global variable SimulationDate.
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  New function Sim_Start_Date().

(2005-09-30)
------------
+ SC_Interface.h/.cpp:
  New data types SC_DLL_DATA_LICENSE_CONTROLLERS and SC_DLL_DATA_SIM_TIME_OF_DAY.
+ lsa_puff.h/.cpp:
  New global variable SimulationTimeOfDay.
+ sc_dll_functions.h/.cpp:
  New function Sim_Time_of_Day().

(2005-05-02)
------------     
+ lsa_rahm.h: 
  CONTROLLER_DLL_NAME #defined as "simpledll.dll"
- sc_dll_functions.cpp: 
  SG_SetState() uses index in call of VonLSA() where it should use sg_no.
  This will cause calls of SG_SetState() to affect the wrong signal groups
  and can cause the signal controller DLL to crash.
