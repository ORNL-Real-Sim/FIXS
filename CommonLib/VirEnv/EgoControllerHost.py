"""EgoControllerHost -- load a user-written ego controller, and run it (#325).

A controller is a Python file the scenario names. FIXS imports it and calls one
function per step; the function reads the ego's state and writes a command onto
it. There is no base class to inherit, no registry, and no socket::

    # apps/<app>/my_controller.py
    def control(ego, dt):
        ego.set(acceleratorPedalDesired=0.30,
                brakePedalDesired=0.00,
                steerAngleDesired=0.10)

    # scenario yaml
    EgoSetup:
      ActuationSource: user
      Controller:      apps/<app>/my_controller.py


WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A CLIENT
-----------------------------------
A controller can already run as an ordinary FIXS client, and for most work it
should: its own process, killable, isolated, and a crash cannot take the bridge
down with it. The one thing it cannot do there is beat the feed. TrafficLayer
exchanges at 0.1 s, so a client sees state once per feed and its command is held
across every world step in between -- with CarlaTimeStep 0.05 that is one whole
step of a 50 ms-stale command, every feed, forever.

This hook exists for exactly that gap. An embedded controller is called from
inside the bridge's step loop, so it sees the pose the backend just measured and
its command is applied before the next tick. Nothing is serialised; it is a
function call.

The rate is therefore not configurable and never has been: it is a consequence
of where the controller lives.

    ActuationSource: user, no Controller   own process, over FIXS -> feed rate
    ActuationSource: user +  Controller    in the bridge          -> CarlaTimeStep

Because both deployments write through ``ego.set``, the same file runs either
way -- which makes "does the fast loop actually change the result?" a one-
variable experiment instead of an argument.


THE TWO COMMAND SHAPES
----------------------
Which fields you write IS which plant interface you are commanding through
(see fixs.commandKind):

    ego.set(acceleratorPedalDesired=, brakePedalDesired=, steerAngleDesired=)
        pedals + steer. YOU close the loop; your rate is the loop rate.
        Carla: apply_control.

    ego.set(speedDesired=, steerAngleDesired=)
        speed + steer. THE PLANT closes the loop, at its own rate with its own
        gains. Carla: apply_ackermann_control.

The second is worth trying before reaching for this hook at all: it gives a fast
inner loop on the plant's side without an in-process controller. It also moves
the tuning out of your reach, which is the trade.


WHAT `ego` CARRIES, AND HOW FRESH IT IS
---------------------------------------
Two clocks meet in one record, and pretending otherwise is how a controller
computes a time-to-collision from two different instants:

    LIVE, this call      positionX/Y/Z, heading, speed, acceleration
    HELD since the feed  speedDesired      (the eco advisory -- genuinely 10 Hz)
                         signalLightColor  (the traffic simulator owns the phase)
    ego.feedAge          seconds since the last feed: how old the held ones are

A controller that ignores ``feedAge`` is fine. One that differentiates a held
field, or divides a live field by a held one, needs to know.


LIFECYCLE
---------
``setup`` and ``shutdown`` are optional; ``control`` is not.

    setup(config, egoId) -> state        once, before the run
    control(ego, dt, state=None)         every step
    shutdown(state)                      once, after

A class named ``Controller`` is accepted in place of the functions, with
``__init__(config, egoId)`` and ``control(ego, dt)``. Neither form inherits
anything: FIXS checks for the method, never for a base class.


WHAT A CONTROLLER MUST NOT DO
-----------------------------
* **Touch the backend or the simulator.** State arrives as an argument. A
  controller that grabs a ``carla`` handle stops working under an XIL plant and
  in ``tests/VirEnv/replay_core.py``, where there is no simulator at all.
* **Call fixs.recv() or fixs.send().** Embedded, the bridge owns the tick; a
  controller calling them corrupts the protocol. That is also why a controller
  is a function rather than a script with its own loop -- the deployment
  supplies the loop.

An exception from ``control`` stops the run and names the file. It does not fall
back to EgoDriver: a silent fallback produces a run that looks fine and is not,
which is the failure mode this codebase has paid for most.


NOTE ON THE MIRROR
------------------
CommonLib/VirEnv/*.py and Carla/VirEnv/*.py are peers of C++ files, name for name
(#335). This module deliberately has NO C++ twin: importing a user's .py at
runtime is a Python capability, and the C++ bridge will not grow one shaped like
this. Keeping it in its own module is what lets the mirrored files stay mirrored
-- an earlier cut of this put the run half inside Carla/VirEnv/mainVirCarla.py,
which quietly made that file stop being a faithful peer of mainVirCarla.cpp.

For the same reason EgoDriver is left exactly as it is. It has a C++ twin, and
_driveEgoFallback applies through the actor rather than through a backend verb,
so routing it through this contract would change the verb transcript
tests/VirEnv/test_core_parity.py compares. EgoDriver is not "the default
implementation of this hook"; it is the built-in driver, and this is a second,
Python-only slot beside it. The cost of that honesty is that EgoDriver cannot
emit the speed+steer shape -- a missing feature, not a reason to restructure.
