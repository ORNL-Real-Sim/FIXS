"""A ready-made driver for the FIXS ego (#24, FIXS#325).

    import fixs
    Controller = fixs.driver()

That is a working controller. The scenario names the file it lives in, FIXS
finds ``Controller`` in it, and calls ``control(ego, dt)`` every step.

WITH A DYNAMOMETER, you write the one function FIXS cannot::

    import fixs
    import my_dyno_rig                      # yours, and no business of FIXS

    def exchange(vref, dt):
        return my_dyno_rig.run_point(vref)  # a speed in, the speed reached out

    Controller = fixs.driver(exchange)

Your rig keeps its own API, its own protocol and its own rate; ``exchange``
is the glue, and it is the whole of what this module asks for.

Pass nothing and nothing is in the loop. This module never goes looking for a
dyno -- deciding one is there belongs to the caller, so passing a function IS
the declaration. For the simulated dyno, pass the one FIXS already has::

    Controller = fixs.driver(fixs.xil.exchange)

which is a function like any other and holds no privilege over yours.

WHERE IT GOES IN THE LOOP -- after every decision, before any command::

    want = target(ego)        the advisory, capped by the signal and the leader
    want = exchange(want)     what a real vehicle did with that
    drive(want)               pedals, or a speed for the plant to close on

Next step the driver reads ``ego.speed`` back, so the dyno is in the loop and
not beside it. ``target`` and ``drive`` are public for anyone who wants that
ordering in their own hands.

HOW IT DECIDES A SPEED. Every input that can demand less is turned into a SPEED
-- the fastest the ego may go and still stop comfortably for the thing that
input names -- and the command is their minimum::

    target = min(eco advisory, next signal, vehicle ahead)

One unit removes the arbitration, and puts the signal and the leader on a
horizon that matches the stopping distance: FIXS reports both from ~200 m,
where a stock CARLA agent finds a red light within 5 m and a leader within
about 13 m, neither of which is a stopping distance at 10-14 m/s.

CARLA-BOUND, deliberately. Steering comes from CARLA's own BehaviorAgent on
CARLA's own vehicle -- ``carla.bind`` hands it FIXS's corrected world and the
route the ego already has, ``carla.refresh`` brings it up to this tick. The
longitudinal half touches only wire fields and ``ego.set``, so it would move to
another backend; the lateral half would not. A non-CARLA driver is a second
module, not a refactor of this one.

IN-PROCESS is not a style choice. On the 0.1 s feed path the record's ``speed``
carries the eco advisory rather than the measured speed, so a controller
closing a speed loop there reads back its own setpoint (FIXS#305).

#:
#: On by default, which is a JUDGEMENT and not a neutral setting. CARLA's
#: lateral controller still needs tuning here, so the longitudinal plant is
#: deliberately taken out of the picture while that work happens: a run then
#: shows what the agent DECIDED rather than what the vehicle could deliver, and
#: a lateral result is not confounded by a speed the vehicle failed to hold.
#: The cost is that a vehicle tracking like this is not a vehicle -- the stiff
#: gains ring at about 1 Hz on every speed plateau -- so energy and comfort

#:            Keeps an explicit acceleration target, which is what an
#:            acceleration or jerk limit would need. NOT the default: aMeasured
#:            is differenced speed and lags the pedal by 0.25 s, and a pure
#:            integrator around that lag limit-cycles at 1.6 s. No gain removes
#:            it -- measured, amplitude moves with the gains, period does not.
